This repository contains a collection of labs from the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence module, completed during my third year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

# Lab Summaries 

### Lab 1: Introduction to Prolog 
- Installed SWI Prolog and explored basic concepts using sample knowledge bases.  
- Completed introductory exercises to familiarize myself with Prolog syntax and queries.

### Lab 2: Python, NumPy & Prolog 
- Investigated arrays and vectors in Python using NumPy within a Jupyter Notebook.  
- Focused on matrix operations and understanding the differences between arrays and vectors.  
- Introduced Prolog concepts such as unification and proof through practical exercises.

### Lab 3: Perceptron in Python and Prolog Recursion
- Implemented a perceptron as a decision-making model using Python, completing tasks in a Jupyter Notebook.  
- Solved the Monkey and Banana Problem in Prolog, emphasizing state representation and recursion.

### Lab 4: Python Matrix Operations and Prolog State Transitions
- Demonstrated matrix multiplication in Python and extended the perceptron work from Lab 3.  
- Enhanced the Monkey and Banana solution in Prolog by adding state transitions for the monkey to eat the banana.

### Lab 5: Media Advisor Expert System and Perceptron Training
- Extended the Media Advisor expert system in Prolog by adding additional rules and improving knowledge representation.  
- Applied perceptron training formulas to simulate logical gates (AND, OR, XOR) using a spreadsheet model.

### Lab 6: Implementing and Training a Perceptron 
- Focused on implementing and training a single-layer perceptron to learn logical functions (AND, OR, XOR) using both step and sigmoid activation functions.  
- The perceptron adjusted its weights and bias during training to minimize errors, successfully learning simple tasks (AND, OR) while facing challenges with the more complex XOR function.  
- Explored the effects of varying learning rates and training iterations on the perceptron's performance.

### Lab 7: List Recursion in Prolog 
- Completed LPN exercises focusing on list recursion in Prolog.
- Developed `number_translation.pl`, a program that translates numbers between German and English, utilizing a recursive predicate `listtran/2` for handling both directions of translation.
- Implemented `twice_list.pl`, which duplicates each element in a list using a recursive approach with the predicate `twice/2`.
- Reinforced my understanding of recursion and its practical applications in list processing within Prolog.

### Lab 8: Neural Network Implementation, Cost Calculation, and Prolog Exercises
- Implemented a feedforward neural network with 4 input features, 5 output values, and a weight matrix (5x4) to process 16 input samples.  
- Wrote functions for `feedforward()` to calculate activations and `getCost()` to compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost. 
- Modified the network architecture by adding a second hidden layer of 6 neurons and adjusted both the feedforward and cost calculation functions accordingly.  
- Evaluated network performance by testing the forward pass and computing the average MSE cost over all samples.  
- Practiced various Prolog exercises for the lab test, reinforcing key concepts like recursion, list manipulation, logical queries, and pathfinding algorithms.
